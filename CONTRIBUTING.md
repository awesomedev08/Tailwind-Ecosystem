## **BUI: Contributing**

Thank you for considering contributing to BUI! We are a Tailwind-based React component library designed specifically for building back-office platforms in the real estate industry. BUI is the core UI of several DD360 company products. We value and appreciate all contributions, whether they are small fixes, feature enhancements or issues reports.
Feature Highlights

## **BUI stands out for its focus on performance and lightness compared to other similar libraries on the market. Some notable features include:**

    Designed for real estate: Our library is specially focused on addressing the needs of the real estate industry, providing a user experience optimized for this domain.

    Integrated Tailwind CSS: We export all of Tailwind's CSS, which allows you to use the library without the need to install Tailwind separately. However, if you wish to customize it and use components specific to your project, you have the flexibility to do so.

    Complete testing: Each BUI component comes with its own test file to guarantee the quality of the code. We aim to achieve 100% test coverage for the most important functionalities.
